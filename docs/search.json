Note countries, United Kingdom, allow distribution true postal addresses due licensing restrictions.formatted address logically composed one address components. example, address “111 8th Avenue, New York, NY” consists following components: “111” (street number), “8th Avenue” (route), “New York” (city) “NY” (US state).parse formatted address programmatically.
