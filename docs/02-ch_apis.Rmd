# Companies House APIs

## Companies House API overview

Companies House is an executive agency of the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BEIS). Our main functions are: to incorporate and dissolve limited companies; examine and store company information delivered under the Companies Act and related legislation; and make this information available to the public.

The Companies House API lets you retrieve information about limited companies (and other companies that fall within the Companies Act 2006). The data returned is live and real-time, and is simple to use and understand.

## Before you start

If you are new to the Companies House API, take a look at the get started guide, which has resources and information to help you.

In the Developer Forum, you can also discuss the API, find help and provide feedback.

## Register a Companies House user account

You must register a user account with Companies House to explore and perform tests with the Companies House API.

To get started quickly, each Companies House API reference page contains an embedded explorer to try out the service without having to write any client code.

## About the Companies House API

Companies House digitally records almost all the information it receives and makes this available to the public through its website and through the Companies House RESTful API.

Being RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally unique URI, and the operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs. Data can be easily consumed by issuing simple GET requests on the required resource URI.

Read the Companies House REST API overview for more information about our API approach, REST web services and the JSON data format.

## API authentication

Access to API services requires authentication. The Companies House API requires API authentication credentials to be sent with each request, which is sent as an API key, stream key or OAuth access token.

Learn how to create an application as well as API keys, stream keys and OAuth web clients.

## Developer guidelines
Read the developer guidelines for information about security, API rate limits and enumerated types as youâ€™re developing your application.

# Developer guidelines
## API rate limits
Rate limiting is applied to the Companies House API to ensure a high quality service is delivered for all users, and to protect client applications from unexpected loops.

You can make up to 600 requests within a 5 minute period. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code for each request made within the rest of the 5 minute time frame. At the end of the period, your rate limit will reset back to 600 requests.

If you have an application that requires a higher rate limit than this default, contact us.

## Enumerated types
A majority of the resources returned by the Companies House API contain members that reference enumeration types. This helps the resources to be self-documenting, and allows clients to interpret the meaning of a resource member without needing to parse a text description.

Enumeration types are used to supplement or replace a text description. This allows clients to display their own version of a description or provide descriptions in multiple languages.

The collection of enumeration types used by Companies House are available on GitHub. These files provide mapping between enumeration type and text description, and are divided into sets or classes. Each API resource member will define which class of enumeration is being returned.

A planned enhancement to the enumeration scheme is the provision of API endpoints that will return the enumeration class catalogue. This avoids enumerations having to be hard-coded within a client, and by periodically checking for change through ETags, clients do not have to download the full catalogue.

## Data resources
Data is mostly returned as JSON documents. Your application must be able to handle the order of document members changing over time and expect to receive members it has not seen before.

## Application security
The API can only be accessed over Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend using TLS 1.2.

## API key security
It is important to keep your API keys secure. This will prevent them from being discovered, your account from being compromised and your rate-limit quota from being exceeded.

### Do not embed API keys in your code
Storing keys in your application code increases the risk that they will be discovered, particularly if any of your source code is made public or it can be viewed by people who should not have access to the key. Instead, you should consider storing them inside environment variables or configuration.

### Do not store API keys in your source tree
If you store API keys in files, for example, configuration or environment files, do not store them inside the application source tree. If all or part of the source is made public, the key may be compromised.

### Restrict API key use by IP address and domain
Limit the use of a key to a specific IP address or domain to reduce its usefulness if it becomes compromised.

### Regenerate your API keys
Regenerate your API keys regularly, including with each application release, to reduce the chance that a key will be discovered.

### Delete API keys when no longer required
Remove unused keys from your registered applications page to limit the number of entry points into your account.
